# Backlog (Low Priority / Later)

Use this list for ideas we want to do later but not right now.

## How to Add Items
- Keep each item short: action + outcome.
- Add tags: `impact` (`low|med|high`) and `effort` (`S|M|L`).
- Optional: add `revisit` note (milestone/date/dependency).

Example:
- [ ] Improve browse filters UX (`impact: low`, `effort: M`, `revisit: after donor MVP`)

---

## Later / Low Priority
- [ ] Persist donor preferences to DB and prefill onboarding form (`impact: med`, `effort: M`, `revisit: after need flow polish`)
- [ ] Add donor onboarding completion confirmation page (`impact: low`, `effort: S`)
- [ ] Add tests around auth navbar injection (`impact: med`, `effort: M`)
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for donor onboarding flow (welcome → preferences → confirmation) (`impact: high`, `effort: M`)
- [ ] Add need-state guard across onboarding to block revisits/edits after submission (`impact: high`, `effort: M`)
- [ ] Add Profile "View Need" button + dedicated need review page (read-only first), then expand with secure reviewer/individual communications and supplemental document uploads (`impact: high`, `effort: L`, `revisit: after profile MVP hardening`)

## Done (Optional)
- Move completed items here with date if you want historical context.
